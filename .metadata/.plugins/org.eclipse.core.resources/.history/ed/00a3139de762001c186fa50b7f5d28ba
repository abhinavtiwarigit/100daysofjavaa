If the user enters 1 then keep taking input from the user for a student’s marks(out of 100). 
If they enter 0 then stop.
If he/ she scores :
Marks >=90 -> print “This is Good”
89 >= Marks >= 60 -> print “This is also Good”
59 >= Marks >= 0 -> print “This is Good as well”
	Because marks don’t matter but our effort does.
(Hint : use do-while loop but think & understand why)
